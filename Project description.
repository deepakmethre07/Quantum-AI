This project simulates the E91 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol using the Qiskit framework. An entangled Bell state (Φ⁺) is generated and
shared between two parties, Alice and Bob, by a source. Both users randomly choose their measurement bases and measure their respective qubits.
When the chosen bases match, the measurement results are perfectly correlated and used to generate a secure secret key. When the bases differ, 
the results are used for security checking. The simulation demonstrates how quantum entanglement and measurement randomness enable secure key 
generation and highlights the principles of quantum cryptography.
